Precedence and Associativity in Java
When evaluating expressions, Java follows specific rules to decide which operators execute first. These rules are called Operator Precedence and Associativity.
ðŸ”¹ 1. Operator Precedence
Operator precedence determines which operator is executed first in an expression that contains multiple operators.

âœ… Example:
int result = 10 + 2 * 5;  
System.out.println(result);
Output:t
20
ðŸ”¹ Why?
* (Multiplication) has higher precedence than + (Addition).
So, 2 * 5 is calculated first â†’ 10 + 10 = 20.
