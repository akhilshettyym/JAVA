Comments in Java
Comments in Java are used to explain code, make it more readable, and help developers understand the logic behind certain parts of a program. The compiler ignores comments, so they do not affect the program’s execution.

Types of Comments in Java
1️⃣ Single-Line Comments (//)
Used to comment out a single line of code.
Everything after // on that line is ignored by the compiler.

✅ Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is a single-line comment
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!"); // Printing a message
    }
}
2️⃣ Multi-Line Comments (/* ... */)
Used for multiple lines of comments.
Everything between /* and */ is ignored by the compiler.

✅ Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
         This is a multi-line comment.
         It can span multiple lines.
        */
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
3️⃣ Documentation Comments (/** ... */)
Special type of comment used for generating documentation using Javadoc.
It supports tags like @param, @return, and @author.

✅ Example:
/**
 * This class demonstrates Java documentation comments.
 * @author Akhil
 * @version 1.0
 */
public class Main {
    
    /**
     * This method prints a welcome message.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
