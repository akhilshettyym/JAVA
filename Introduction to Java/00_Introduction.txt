📌 Introduction to Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language widely used for web development, mobile apps, enterprise software, and more. It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

🔹 Features of Java
Java is popular because of the following key features:

1️⃣ Simple & Easy to Learn – Java’s syntax is similar to C/C++, making it easy for beginners.
2️⃣ Object-Oriented – Everything in Java revolves around objects, classes, and encapsulation.
3️⃣ Platform-Independent – Java code runs on any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) via the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
4️⃣ Secure – Java provides built-in security features like garbage collection and exception handling.
5️⃣ Multithreaded – Java supports multithreading, enabling efficient task execution.
6️⃣ Robust – Java’s strict type-checking, exception handling, and garbage collection make it stable.
7️⃣ Portable – Write once, run anywhere (WORA).
8️⃣ Dynamic & Extensible – Java supports dynamic linking and libraries like JDBC, Servlets, etc.
9️⃣ High Performance – Though Java is not as fast as C++, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation boosts performance.
🔟 Distributed Computing – Java can develop distributed applications using RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans).

🔹 Java Architecture
Java programs follow a specific execution process:

1️⃣ Java Compilation Process
Java programs do not compile directly to machine code; instead, they follow these steps:

✅ Write Code: Java code is written in .java files.
✅ Compilation: The Java compiler (javac) converts .java files into bytecode (.class files).
✅ Execution: The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) interprets bytecode and executes it on any OS.

🔹 Java Editions
Java has different editions based on usage:

1️⃣ Java SE (Standard Edition) – Used for core applications, desktop apps, and general development.
2️⃣ Java EE (Enterprise Edition) – Used for large-scale web applications and enterprise software.
3️⃣ Java ME (Micro Edition) – Used for embedded systems and mobile applications.
4️⃣ Java FX – Used for developing rich internet applications (RIA).

🔹 Java Development Kit (JDK)
To write and run Java programs, you need the JDK (Java Development Kit), which includes:

✅ JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – Runs Java programs.
✅ JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – Converts bytecode into machine code.
✅ Java Compiler (javac) – Converts Java code into bytecode.
✅ Libraries & Tools – Provides useful classes for development.
