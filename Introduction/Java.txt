1. Introduction to Java
Brief Overview
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. It is platform-independent due to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows code to run on any operating system.

Key Features of Java
Platform Independent – Uses JVM to run anywhere (Write Once, Run Anywhere).
Object-Oriented – Supports Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
Secure – Includes built-in security features and memory management.
Robust & Multithreaded – Manages memory automatically and supports multiple threads.
Widely Used – Used in web applications, mobile development (Android), and enterprise software.
Example Applications of Java
Android Development (via Android SDK)
Web Applications (Spring Boot, JSP)
Big Data & Machine Learning (Hadoop, Apache Spark)
Game Development (Minecraft is written in Java).
