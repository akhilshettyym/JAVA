/*
 * The Comparable interface allows an object to define its own sorting rule using the compareTo() method.
 *
 * - The compareTo() method is used to compare objects.
 * - It returns:
 *      - Negative value if 'this' object should come first in sorting.
 *      - Positive value if the other object should come first.
 *      - Zero if both are considered equal in sorting.
 *
 * - Many Java classes like String and Integer already implement Comparable, allowing sorting without a Comparator.

/*Comparator vs. Comparable
A comparator is an object with one method that is used to compare two different objects.

A comparable is an object which can compare itself with other objects.

It is easier to use the Comparable interface when possible, but the Comparator interface is 
more powerful because it allows you to sort any kind of object even if you cannot change its code.*/
